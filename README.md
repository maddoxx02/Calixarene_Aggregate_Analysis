# Calixarene Aggregate Analysis

## Introduction

This repo presents the results of analysing aggregate behaviour of Calixarene group compounds (thiacalix[4]-crown-ethers) under various synthesis conditions. By varying the compound, solvent, mixture temperatures and concentration during the synthesis procedure, we acquire twelve individual films displaying different aggregate behaviour. Using a combination of machine learning, image segmentation and Data analysis, we explore the relation of synthesis conditions to the occurrence of aggregates on the surface of these films. These films with aggregates are primarily aimed at being used as drug carriers in medicine. This research aims to explore the underlying relation between the behaviour of aggregates & their properties with those of the synthesis conditions, therefore allowing theoretical prediction of aggregate properties before conducting complete chemical synthesis. Further, this repo consists of the Python code, generated results and data analysis performed on the results.
